My undergraduate research, titled "Survival of common foodborne pathogens on dried apricots made with and without sulfur dioxide treatment," investigated the survival rates of pathogens like Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes on dried apricots. The study explored the impact of sulfur dioxide treatment on these pathogens, analyzing factors such as pH, water activity, and sulfur content. The findings provided valuable insights into the behavior of foodborne pathogens during drying and storage, contributing to the understanding of food safety in dried fruit processing. This research reflects my early engagement with food microbiology and my dedication to enhancing food safety practices.
